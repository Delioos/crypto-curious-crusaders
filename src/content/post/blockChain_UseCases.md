# Introduction

Despite the recent rise of artificial intelligence, the blockchain remains a hot topic in the world of technology.
Everyone talks about it, dreads it or speculates about it. But at the end of the day
what is it good for?

Let's explore the practical uses of this revolutionary technology, which has the
the potential to transform many sectors.

# A free digital currency system

blockchain, Bitcoin offers a free digital currency, enabling everyone to control

borders.

# The arrival of Solidity

With
the appearance of Ethereum and its programming language Solidity in late
July 2015, blockchain reached a new milestone. Smart
contracts (contracts deployed on the ethereum blockchain) make it possible to
develop complex decentralized applications capable of
solve real-life problems. The ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments)
introduced into the protocol have opened up new possibilities,
offering a dynamic and scalable ecosystem for developers.

# The introduction of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

To
simply put, an NFT is simply a special type of token which
represents a single, indivisible asset. These tokens make it possible to
open new doors in the world of art, physical property and many other
property and many other areas that we will explore here.

# Virtualized art

In
the art world, NFTs have enabled artists to monetize their work in an
their work in an unprecedented way. They can create and sell
unique digital works of art in the form of NFTs, offering
exclusive and verifiable ownership of these creations.
This has also opened up opportunities for artists to earn
royalties with each resale of the work on the secondary market. For

artists. If the pricing and speculation aspect (and maximum
speculation (and maximum decentralization) is more your thing, competitor [blur](http://blur.io/) is a great platform.

# Object traceability in gaming

The
video games have long suffered from problems such as inventory hacks
and dubious resale platforms. However, thanks to
NFTs, these problems can be solved in innovative ways.
Take [Treeverse](https://www.treeverse.net/),
a game inspired by classics such as Zelda, Dofus and Genshin
Impact. It uses NFTs to manage faction real estate (plots)
and player skins (the "Timeless Characters" collection). The
NFTrees are at the heart of the gameplay, allowing players to own unique and
assets.

A
example is Noobizes, a platform that aspires to replace established
established players like Faceit. Thanks to the use of game APIs
games and anchoring game scores in the blockchain, Noobizes
ensures fair and transparent competition. Tournament-winnable NFTs
and tokens bring real cashflow to the players most determined
determined to make a living from their passion.

# Passes, membership cards to join DAOs

The
DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are decentralized
autonomous entities that operate on the blockchain. To
access these communities, NFTs can be used as passes or membership cards, guaranteeing
membership cards, guaranteeing membership of exclusive circles and
transparent community governance.

# Fair remuneration for musicians

The
blockchain offers solutions for complex problems, such as
equitable remuneration for musical artists. Projects like [Bolero](http://www.boleromusic.com/)
use blockchain to enable listeners to fund small artists
artists directly, bypassing intermediaries and ensuring a more

# Tracking funds for associations, governments

The
blockchain has the potential to revolutionize fund management for
social-profit organizations, and even governments. For example,
the recently publicized case of the Marianne fund, where money intended to
radicalization was used in a dubious manner,
could be avoided thanks to total traceability of funds on the
blockchain. This technology would enable unprecedented
transparency, reassuring citizens as to the use of the funds
collected.

The
blockchain is more than just a technological trend,
it has the power to profoundly transform our society. From

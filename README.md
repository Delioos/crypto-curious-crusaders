# CCC 

## The Blog
You can check out  [the blog](https://cccrusaders.cc) directly !

## Description 
This a side project started by [Tricky](https://github.com/Perrier-Remi/) and myself.

The main goal of the blog was to build up a solid knowledge base in our fields : 
- cyber secu for him at this moment
- web and DeFi for myself

Sharing an openminded vision of the platform, we plan to invite more people to post about their passions, such as Economics, Entrepreneurship or laws and compliance. 
This is also a great exercise to push ourselves in the builders journey.

## Tech Stack 
I solo built the website using the fantasticly powerful [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework.
It has an amazing fit for content creation due to its SSR focus with elements such as dynamic islands.
Moreover, Astro is so great for a blog creation because it can render markdown files on its own. So we (writers) just had to use markdown editors to create our articles (such as notion or obsidian).

## Design 
Here is a quick preview of the minimalist style we chose.

We really wanted to focus on the content before anything else.
